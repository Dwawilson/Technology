A new DataFrame was created with the variables "Arrest Date" and "Charges Description".
The index was set and the arrest dates were sorted and verified by showing the top 5 and top bottom arrest dates/charge description in the dataset.
The dataset was further filtered to show only specific Charges that were related to sex crimes.
The results of the data analysis were displayed using a line graph to show a steady decrease in arrests due to sexually related crimes over the past 9 years.

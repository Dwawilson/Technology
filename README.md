Shot Spotter was used by the CPD from 2018 to the present. Community public safety groups claim that this technology caused a disproportionate amount of arrests amoungst minority groups.

My code creates a new dataframe which contains firearm related arrests in Chicago from 2018 to 2022. The code plots a bar graph which shows the amount of firearm arrests by race, and a line graph which shows the amount of firearm related charges minorities have received each year.
